# Trail-monkey

## I allow everyone to update this mod and submit it to this github as ill be gone from modding for a while

Gives your monkey a trail (client only)

Go to \GorillaTag\BepInEx\config and open TrailMonke.cfg To change if its enabled, the size of the trail at start and end, the time it can be "alive", and the color of the trail

Or use my BepInExConfigManager to configure the trail here https://github.com/jona939s/BepInExConfigManager/releases

For colors use this site https://www.color-hex.com

For download, go to Releases
